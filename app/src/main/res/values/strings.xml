    <string name="balloon_glass_description">Balloon wine glasses are a type of wine glass, usually used to drink red wines, that are characterized by an almost spherical shape that is much more rounded than other types of wine glass.

    <string name="highball_glass_description">A highball glass is a glass tumbler used to serve ‘tall’ cocktails and other mixed drinks that contain a large proportion of a non-alcoholic mixer, and are poured over ice.

    <string name="beer_cocktail_glass_description">Weizen glasses are often confused with pilsner glasses, due to their similar shape and size. The main difference between these two styles, is that the Weizen glasses have more curvature to them, especially at the top of the glass. Starting with a strong, narrow base, the glass has a distinctive curve to it as it goes up. This type of beer glass is much taller than a pint glass, and usually holds at least ½ a liter of beer.Another important characteristic, weizen glasses are designed for and primarily used for wheat beers (Weizenbier). The curved lip at the top of the glass helps trap and encourage a thick foam head, allowing for you to appreciate the full aroma and flavor that comes along with wheat beers.However, be wary of the fruit that is usually served on the rim of wheat beers, especially at bars, as the acidity and juice of the fruit could destroy the foam head.</string>
    <string name="beer_mug_description">The beer mug is incredibly robust, easy to use and holds a lot of beer. Common in England, Germany and the United States, this type of beer glass comes in all sizes.The main characteristic of the beer mug is its wide cylindrical shape with a handle on the side. The thick glass walls helps insulate your brew to keep it cool, while the handle helps prevent your hands from inadvertently warming up your beer (or dropping it when you’ve had too many).Sometimes beer mugs will have dimples throughout the glass. While most believe this is merely for decorative purposes, others argue that the dimples help a drinker appreciate the overall color and clarity of their beer.No matter what you believe, there’s no denying the popularity of this beer glass. They’re easy to use, strong enough to toast your friends in a hearty manner, and it holds plenty of beer!</string>
    <string name="brandy_snifter_description">A brandy snifter is a short, wide, stemmed glass used to serve (you guessed it) brandy. It resembles an extraordinarily squat wine glass, with a voluminous bowl and low center of gravity. A snifter can be used for any spirit, really (and a number of cocktails), but it\'s most commonly associated with cognac, other brandies, whiskey, and port or other fortified wines.The brandy snifter is designed with two purposes in mind: evaporation and concentration of aromas. Its wide bowl leaves a large surface area, which allows the volatile, aromatic compounds plenty of room to waft off the spirit. The wide base then narrows into a smaller opening, which concentrates those compounds and prevents them from escaping in all directions (like a coupe glass might).From there, it\'s a simple matter of gently raising the glass to your nose and enjoying the aromas before taking a sip. It\'s a straightforward design, and it adds a nice touch of class to the presentation of your favorite spirit.</string>
    <string name="champagne_glass_description">The flute style is typically the most popular glass shape for Champagne; it looks elegant and features a nice long stem making it easy for the hand; it’s probably the most recognisable. The elongated shape provides a good-sized serving, allowing plenty of Champagne to be held within your bowl and excess bubbles on the initial pour from bottle to glass.The long stem is essential as it allows you to place your hand here rather than on the bowl, thus preventing your wine from warming too quickly and stopping your fingers from marking the glass.</string>
    <string name="cocktail_glass_description">A cocktail glass is a stemmed glass which has a cone-shaped bowl placed upon a stem above a flat base. It is mainly used to serve cocktails. Its form derives from the fact that all cocktails are traditionally served chilled and contain an aromatic element.

It is named after the Collins cocktail, made with gin, lemon juice, and sugar and traditionally served in this type of glass.It is typically used for cocktails; specifically those served “on the rocks,” meaning over ice.

The tall and slender shape of the Collins glass also allows the drink to be easily garnished with fruit or herbs.</string>

It\'s more decorative than functional, and isn\'t necessary for any drink aside its volume (usually about 20 ounces, which can accommodate large frozen drinks) and beachy aesthetic.

It derives its name from the Old-Fashioned Cocktail, which is almost served exclusively in old-fashioned glasses.Over the years, the old-fashioned glass has gained immense popularity, in large part because it isn\'t exclusively used for alcoholic drinks—you probably have a few sitting in your cupboard for juice and water.An old-fashioned glass is usually defined as a short, cylindrical tumbler glass with a thick base and straight sides, though many variations exist. It\'s primarily used to serve drinks on the rocks (over ice), but can also be used for certain neat drinks like the Sazerac.

    <string name="parfait_glass_description">The Parfait glass is not used much in American bars but it does have its place. Imported from the soda fountain, where this tall, footed, flare–rimmed glass was used for various ice–cream concoctions, it finds bar use for certain fancy drinks, blender drinks and crushed–ice drinks, often with cream or ice cream in them and usually with elaborate garnishes. Sizes vary greatly—there are mini Parfait glasses, in the 2–3 ounce range, that are used mostly for Pousse–Cafés. Larger ones hover around 8 to 12 ounces. </string>
    <string name="pilsner_glass_beer_description">Structurally, pilsner glasses are tall and slim, made of thin glass and tapered in shape (smaller at the bottom and wider at the top).
